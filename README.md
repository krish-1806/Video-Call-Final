# Agile Methodology Used

Divided the project in three steps:
1. Video Call- to complete the minimum requirement of project and then adding features to it like mute/unmute audio and video and screen sharing.
2. Conversation before start of the meeting 
3. Conversation post meeting
4. And merged them together for continuous flow of application.
