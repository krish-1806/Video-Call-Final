# Agile Methodology Used

Divided the project in three steps:
1. Video Call- to complete the minimum requirement of project and then adding features to it like mute/unmute audio and video and screen sharing.
2. Conversation before start of the meeting 
3. Conversation post meeting
4. And merged them together for continuous flow of application.

## Tech Used:
* Node.js  
* ExpressJS  
* Socket.io  
* PeerJS  
* uuid  
* EJS   
* MomentJS  
* Websocket  
---  
*Node.js*- It is a runtime enviroment that allows us to run JavaScript code independent of web browser.  
  
*ExpressJS*- It is a server framework for Node.js. I used it to run the video chat server.  
  
*Socket.io*- It is a JavaScript library for creating real-time communication apps. I used the server-side library to manage communication between users. Framework for dealing with websockets.  
  
*PeerJS*- It provides free cloud service that I used to host the rooms.  
  
*uuid*- It is a javascript library that is used to create unique Id for the rooms.  
  
*EJS*- It allows us to render and serve HTML files from our Express server. it is where the videos will be shown.  
  
*MomentJS*- It is a JavaScript library that I used to display date in the chat section.  
  
*Websocket*- I used this WebsocketAPI for persistent connection between client and server.
